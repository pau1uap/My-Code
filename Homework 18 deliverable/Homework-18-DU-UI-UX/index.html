    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>Paul Becker has always had a curious mind.  Once in 
        6th grade his teacher had a conversation with him about 
        asking too many questions in class because it distracted 
        from her lesson plan.  She told him, “Paul, never stop 
        asking questions just make sure the ones you’re asking 
        are the right ones to get the answers you seek.”</p>
        <p>This helped to give a scope to the way Paul thought 
        about the world around him and the how and why things 
        function the way they do.  With this mentality Paul 
        gravitated to the arts and design as a way to visualize 
        and communicate solutions to his curiosity. </p>
